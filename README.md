# odin-recipes
This is an Odin project where I will be making a basic webpage with HTML only. It will have a main index page and also have a few links to recipes. 

After finishing this Odin project I feel I have a good grasp on adding links to webpages, adding pictures to webpages, as well as basic formatting using HTML elements such as `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<em>`.
